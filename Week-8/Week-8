Week 8: Linked List

Problem 8.1: Reverse the Linked List
Given a linked list of N nodes, reverse the list.

Problem 8.2: Rotate Linked List
Given a singly linked list of size N and a positive integer k, left-shift the linked list by k nodes.

Problem 8.3: Detect Loop in a Linked List
Given a linked list of N nodes, check if the linked list has a loop.

For each problem, provide the input format, output format, constraints, and expected time and space complexity. Ensure the code follows good coding practices and is modular.
