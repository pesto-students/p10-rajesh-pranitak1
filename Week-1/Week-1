Exercise 1.1:
When a user enters a URL in the browser, the browser follows a series of steps to fetch the desired result. Here's an overview of the process:

a. The main functionality of the browser is to retrieve, interpret, and display web resources. It acts as a client software that communicates with web servers to fetch web pages and render them for the user.

b. The high-level components of a browser include:

- User Interface: Provides the visual and interactive elements for users to interact with the browser.
- Rendering Engine: Responsible for rendering the content of web pages, parsing HTML and CSS, and displaying the final result on the screen.
- Networking: Handles network communication, making HTTP requests to fetch web resources such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.
- JavaScript Engine: Interprets and executes JavaScript code present on web pages.
- Data Storage: Stores browser-specific data like cookies, local storage, and cached resources.

c. The rendering engine is a crucial component of the browser. It receives the HTML and CSS files from the networking component and processes them to generate the visual representation of the web page. It interprets HTML tags, applies CSS styles, and constructs the Document Object Model (DOM) and the Render Tree.

d. Parsers are responsible for parsing HTML, CSS, and other resources. The HTML parser reads the HTML file and constructs the DOM tree, representing the structure of the web page. The CSS parser interprets the CSS files and generates a CSSOM (CSS Object Model) tree, defining the styles to be applied to elements.

e. The script processors handle JavaScript execution. When encountering a script tag or external script file, the browser passes the JavaScript code to the JavaScript engine for interpretation and execution. The JavaScript code can manipulate the DOM, modify CSS styles, handle user interactions, and perform various tasks.

f. The tree construction phase combines the DOM tree and CSSOM tree to create a Render Tree. The Render Tree represents the final layout of the web page, including visual elements like text, images, and boxes to be displayed.

g. The order of script processing is important for ensuring correct behavior and dependencies. Scripts are executed in the order they appear in the HTML file, blocking the rendering process until they complete. If a script modifies the DOM or CSSOM, it can affect the rendering outcome.

h. After the Render Tree is constructed, the browser performs layout, which determines the position and size of each element on the page. Finally, the browser paints the pixels on the screen according to the layout information, resulting in the visual display of the web page.

Exercise 1.2:
To complete exercise 1.2, you can follow these guidelines:

- Set the font of the entire text in the UI to "Lato".
- Use the line awesome Icon library for all icons.
- Use the following image URL for the Cattyboard album image: https://vif1g.csb.app/src/assets/cattyboard.jpg.
- Utilize the specified icons in the assignment, such as la-bars, la-home, la-search, la-volume-up, la-user, la-cog, la-spotify, la-soundcloud, la-play, la-plus, la-ellipsis-h, la-step-backward, la-step-forward, la-undo-alt, and la-random.
- Feel free to use any other font library if you prefer.
