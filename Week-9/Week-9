Problem 9.1: Parenthesis Checker
Given an expression string x, check if the pairs and orders of parentheses, braces, and brackets are correct.

Problem 9.2: Next Greater Element
Given an array arr[] of size N with distinct elements, find the next greater element for each element in the array.

Problem 9.3: Implement a Queue using 2 Stacks
Implement a Queue using two stacks s1 and s2, supporting push and pop operations.

For each problem, provide the input format, output format, constraints, and expected time and space complexity. Ensure the code follows good coding practices and is modular.
