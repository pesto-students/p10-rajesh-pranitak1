Week 10: Graph and Trees

Problem 10.1: Maximum Depth of Binary Tree
Given the root of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.

Problem 10.2: Validate a Binary Tree
Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

Problem 10.3: Binary Tree Level Order Traversal
Given the root of a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values.

Problem 10.4: Find if Path Exists in Graph
Given a graph with n vertices and an array of edges, determine if a valid path exists from a source vertex to a destination vertex.

Problem 10.5: Find the Town Judge
Given trust relationships between people in a town, find the label of the town judge if they exist.

Problem 10.6: All Paths from Source to Target
Given a directed acyclic graph (DAG), find all possible paths from the source node to the target node.

For each problem, provide the input format, output format, constraints, and expected time and space complexity. Ensure the code follows good coding practices and is modular.
